# Porter Delivery Time Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a model that accurately estimates delivery time for Porter orders by analyzing various factors like restaurant type, items ordered, and delivery partner availability.

## Visualizations and Insights

### 1. Order Volume Over Time
This line plot shows the number of orders placed each day over a specific period.

**Insights**:
- The plot reveals trends in order volume, highlighting peaks on weekends and during specific promotions.
- Significant drops or increases may correlate with external factors (e.g., holidays).

### 2. Weekly Order Distribution
This visualization illustrates the distribution of orders per week.

**Insights**:
- Fluctuations in order volume are observed from month to month, correlating with seasonal demand.
- Months with unusually high or low order counts may indicate specific marketing campaigns.

### 4. Order Volume by Day Type (Weekday vs. Weekend)
This visualization compares order volume between weekdays and weekends.

**Insights**:
- The histogram shows whether most deliveries fall within a specific time range or if there are outliers.
- Analyzing delivery times can help identify areas for improvement in the delivery process.

### 6. Order Volume by Hour of the Day
This bar chart depicts the number of orders placed during different hours of the day.
